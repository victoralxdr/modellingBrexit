Final Year BEng Project

This repository aims at presenting the MATLAB code used to model the opinion of the UK population after the EU Referendum took place on 23rd of June 2016.

You will find two different folders.

• Model
Contains the MATLAB files to run the model with default UK opinion distribution as described in the report. Figures and plots have been removed to allow for code readability. (added before the deadline)

•Evaluation models
Contains all the models described in the evaluation section of the report (Scotland, West Midlands and London). (will be added with same parameters as in the report)
